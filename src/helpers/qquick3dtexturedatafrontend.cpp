    \brief Allows creation and population of TextureData from QML.
    \since 6.6

    ProceduralTextureData is a helper type that allows creation of TextureData from QML.
    The TextureData component is Abstract, and is usually created from C++. With
    ProceduralTextureData, it is possible to populate a TextureData from QML.

    \qml
    ProceduralTextureData {
        id: dynamicTextureData
        property color color1: "red"
        property color color2: "black"
        width: 32
        height: 32
        hasTransparency: false
        format: TextureData.RGBA8
        textureData: generateTextureData(color1, color2)

        function generateTextureData(newColor1: color, newColor2 : color) : ArrayBuffer {
            let dataBuffer = new ArrayBuffer(width * height * 4)
            let data = new Uint8Array(dataBuffer)
            // Create a checkered pattern using newColor1 and newColor2
            for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
                for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
                    let index = (x + y * width) * 4
                    let color = (x % 2 === y % 2) ? newColor1 : newColor2
                    data[index + 0] = color.r * 255
                    data[index + 1] = color.g * 255
                    data[index + 2] = color.b * 255
                    data[index + 3] = 255
                }
            }
            return dataBuffer
        }
    }
    \endqml

    In the above code snippet, the function generateTextureData is used to generate a
    checkerboard pattern using the two colors color1 and color2.  By filling an
    ArrayBuffer with the generated data, the textureData property of the TextureData
    is populated.

    This property holds the depth of the texture data in pixels.

    Setting the depth above 0 means that the texture is handled as a 3D texture.

    \value TexureData.ASTC_12x12 The color format is considered as ASTC compressed format with 12x12 block footprint.

    \note With the exception of \c TexureData.RGBA8, not every format is supported at runtime as this
    depends on which backend is being used as well which hardware is being used.

    \note \c TexureData.RGBE is internally represented as an \c TexureData.RGBA8 but is interpreted as described when used
    as a lightProbe or skybox texture.

    \note Using the value \c TexureData.None will assume the default value of \c TexureData.RGBA8

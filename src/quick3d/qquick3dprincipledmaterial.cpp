    \brief Lets you define a material for 3D items using the metal/roughness workflow.

    Before a Model can be rendered in a scene, it must have at least one material attached
    to it that describes how the mesh should be shaded. The PrincipledMaterial is a PBR
    metal/roughness material that aims at being an easy to use material with a minimal
    set of parameters.
    In addition to having few parameters, all input values are strictly normalized
    between 0 and 1 and have sensible defaults, meaning even without changing any values,
    the material can be used to shader a model. For an introduction on how the
    different properties of the principled material affects how a model is shaded,
    see the \l{Qt Quick 3D - Principled Material Example}{Principled Material example}.

    \section1 Metal/Roughness workflow

    The Principled material is what's known as a metal/roughness material, in essence
    that means the main characteristics of the material is controlled through
    the \l {PrincipledMaterial::metalnessMap} {metallness}, \l {PrincipledMaterial::roughnessMap} {roughness},
    and the \l {PrincipledMaterial::baseColorMap} {base color} property.

    \section2 Metalness

    Real world materials are put into two main categories, metals and dielectrics (non-metals).
    In the Principled material, the category a material belongs to is decided by the
    \c metalness value. Setting the \c metalness value to 0, means the material is a dialectric,
    while everything above 0 is a considered to be a metal. In reality metals will have
    a \c metalness value of 1, but values between 0 and 1 are possible, and usually used
    for metals with reduced reflectance. For example, to render corrosion, or similar,
    on a material, the \c metalness of the material should be reduced to give the output
    properties more similar to a dielectric material.
    Since the \c metalness value affects the reflectance of the material it might be tempting to
    use the metalness to adjust glossiness, but consider what type of material you want
    to describe first. Increasing the \c metalness value to give a dielectric material
    a more polished look, will introduce properties that are not accurate for a dielectric
    material, so consider if it would be more appropriate to adjust, for example,
    the \c roughness value instead.

    \section2 Roughness

    The \c roughness of a material describes the condition of an object's surface.
    A low \c roughness value means the object has a smooth surface and therefore be more
    reflective then a material with a higher \c roughness value.

    \section2 Base color

    The \l {PrincipledMaterial::baseColorMap} {base color} of a metal/roughness material
    contains both the diffuse and the specular data, how much the base color is interpreted
    as one or the other is primarily dictated by the \c metalness value. For example,
    a material with a metalness value of 1, will have most of its base color interpreted
    as specular color, while the diffuse color would be a black tint. The opposite would
    happen for a material with a metalness value of 0. This is of course a bit simplified,
    but gives a rough idea how the \l {PrincipledMaterial::baseColor} {base color} and
    \c metalness value interacts. For those more familiar with a Specular/Glossiness workflow,
    there's a clear difference here which is worth noting, namely that the color data of the
    two materials are not directly compatible, since in a Specular/Glossiness
    \l {DefaultMaterial} {material}, the diffuse and specular color comes from separate inputs.

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration PrincipledMaterial::lighting

    This property defines which lighting method is used when generating this
    material.

    The default value is \c PrincipledMaterial.FragmentLighting

    When using \c PrincipledMaterial.FragmentLighting, diffuse and specular lighting is
    calculated for each rendered pixel. Certain effects (such as a Fresnel or normal map) require
    \c PrincipledMaterial.FragmentLighting to work.

    When using \c PrincipledMaterial.NoLighting no lighting is calculated. This
    mode is (predictably) very fast, and is quite effective when image maps are
    used that you do not need to be shaded by lighting. All other shading
    properties except baseColor values, alpha values, and vertex colors will be
    ignored.

    \value PrincipledMaterial.NoLighting
    \value PrincipledMaterial.FragmentLighting
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration PrincipledMaterial::blendMode

    This property determines how the colors of the model rendered blends with
    those behind it.

    \value PrincipledMaterial.SourceOver Default blend mode. Opaque objects
    occlude objects behind them. This default mode does not guarantee alpha
    blending in the rendering pipeline on its own for models that use this
    material, but rather makes the decision dependent on a number of factors:
    if the object's and material's total opacity is \c{1.0}, there is no
    opacity map in the material, and \l alphaMode is not set to a value that
    enforces alpha blending, then the model is treated as opaque, meaning it is
    rendered with depth testing and depth write enabled, together with other
    opaque objects, with blending disabled. Otherwise the model is treated as
    semi-transparent, and is rendered after the opaque objects, together with
    other semi-transparent objects in a back-to-front order based on their
    center's distance from the camera, with alpha blending enabled.

    \value PrincipledMaterial.Screen Colors are blended using an inverted
    multiply, producing a lighter result. This blend mode is order-independent;
    if you are using semi-opaque objects and experiencing 'popping' as faces or
    models sort differently, using Screen blending is one way to produce
    results without popping.

    \value PrincipledMaterial.Multiply Colors are blended using a multiply,
    producing a darker result. This blend mode is also order-independent.

/*!
    \qmlproperty color PrincipledMaterial::baseColor

    This property sets the base color for the material. Depending on the type
    of material specified (metal or dielectric) the diffuse and specular channels will be
    set appropriately. For example, a dielectric material will have a diffuse color equal to
    the base color, while it's specular color, depending on the specular amount, will have a
    bright specular color. For metals the diffuse and specular channels will be mixed from
    the base color and have a dark diffuse channel and a specular channel close to the base color.

    The metalness property defines the \e metalness of the the material. The value
    is normalized, where 0.0 means the material is a \e dielectric (non-metallic) material and
    a value of 1.0 means the material is a metal.

    \note In principle, materials are either dielectrics with a metalness of 0, or metals with a
    metalness of 1. Metalness values between 0 and 1 are still allowed and will give a material that
    is a blend between the different models.

    The range is [0.0, 1.0]. The default value is 0.

    If an emissive map is set, the x, y, and z components are used as factors
    (multipliers) for the R, G and B channels of the texture, respectively.
    The default value is (0, 0, 0) and it means no emissive contribution at all.

    \note Setting the lightingMode to DefaultMaterial.NoLighting means emissive
    Factor does not have an effect on the scene.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty Texture PrincipledMaterial::specularReflectionMap

    This property sets a Texture used for specular highlights on the material.

    This is typically used to perform environment mapping: as the model is
    rotated, the map will appear as though it is reflecting from the
    environment. For this to work as expected, the Texture's
    \l{Texture::mappingMode}{mappingMode} needs to be set to
    Texture.Environment. Specular reflection maps are an easy way to add a
    high-quality look with a relatively low cost.

    \note Associating a \l{SceneEnvironment::lightProbe}{light probe} with the
    \l SceneEnvironment, and thus relying on image-based lighting, can achieve
    similar environmental reflection effects. Light probes are however a
    conceptually different, and when it comes to performance, potentially more
    expensive solution. Each approaches have their own specific uses, and the
    one to use needs to be decided on a case by case basis. When it comes to
    the Texture set to the property, specularReflectionMap has an advantage,
    because it presents no limitations and supports all types of textures,
    including ones that source their data from a Qt Quick sub-scene via
    \l{Texture::sourceItem}{sourceItem}.

    \note Crisp images cause your material to look very glossy; the more you
    blur your image the softer your material will appear.

    The property defines a RGB Texture to modulate the amount and the color of

    reflections from a scenes SceneEnvironment::lightProbe.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real PrincipledMaterial::roughness

    This property controls the size of the specular highlight generated from

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration PrincipledMaterial::alphaMode

    This property specifies how the alpha color value from \l baseColor and the
    alpha channel of a \l{baseColorMap}{base color map} are used.

    \note The alpha cutoff test only considers the base color alpha. \l opacity
    and \l [QtQuick3D] {Node::opacity} are not taken into account there.

    \note When sampling a base color map, the effective alpha value is the
    sampled alpha multiplied by the \l baseColor alpha.

    \value PrincipledMaterial.Default No test is applied, the effective alpha
    value is passed on as-is. Note that a \l baseColor or \l baseColorMap alpha
    less than \c 1.0 does not automatically imply alpha blending, the object
    with the material may still be treated as opaque, if no other relevant
    properties (such as, an opacity less than 1, the presence of an opacity
    map, or a non-default \l blendMode value) trigger treating the object as
    semi-transparent. To ensure alpha blending happens regardless of any other
    object or material property, set \c Blend instead.

    \value PrincipledMaterial.Blend No cutoff test is applied, but guarantees
    that alpha blending happens. The object with this material will therefore
    never be treated as opaque by the renderer.

    \value PrincipledMaterial.Opaque No cutoff test is applied and the rendered
    object is assumed to be fully opaque, meaning the alpha values in the
    vertex color, base color, and base color map are ignored and a value of 1.0
    is substituted instead. This mode does not guarantee alpha blending does
    not happen. If relevant properties (such as, an opacity less than 1, an
    opacity map, or a non-default \l blendMode) say so, then the object will
    still be treated as semi-transparent by the rendering pipeline, just like
    with the \c Default alphaMode.

    \value PrincipledMaterial.Mask A test based on \l alphaCutoff is applied.
    If the effective alpha value falls below \l alphaCutoff, the fragment is
    changed to fully transparent and is discarded (with all implications of
    discarding: the depth buffer is not written for that fragment). Otherwise
    the alpha is changed to 1.0, so that the fragment will become fully opaque.
    When it comes to alpha blending, the behavior of this mode is identical to
    \c Opaque, regardless of the cutoff test's result. This means that the
    \l{https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#alpha-coverage}{glTF
    2 spec's alpha coverage} Implementation Notes are fulfilled. Objects with
    alpha cutoff tests can also cast shadows since they behave like opaque
    objects by default, unless the relevant properties (such as, an opacity
    less than 1, an opacity map, or a non-default \l blendMode) imply otherwise
    (in which case casting shadows will not be possible).

/*!

    The alphaCutoff property can be used to specify the cutoff value when using

    below the threshold will be rendered fully transparent (\c{0.0} for all
    color channels). When the alpha value is equal or greater than the cutoff
    value, the color will not be affected in any way.

    The default value is 0.5.

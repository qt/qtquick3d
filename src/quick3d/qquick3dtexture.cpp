    \qmltype Texture
    \inherits Object3D
    \inqmlmodule QtQuick3D
    \brief Defines a texture for use in 3D scenes.

    A texture is technically any array of pixels (1D, 2D or 3D) and its related
    settings, such as minification and magnification filters, scaling and UV
    transformations.

    The Texture type in Qt Quick 3D represents a two-dimensional image. Its use
    is typically to map onto / wrap around three-dimensional geometry to emulate
    additional detail which cannot be efficiently modelled in 3D. It can also be
    used to emulate other lighting effects, such as reflections.

    While Texture itself always represents a 2D texture, other kinds of
    textures are available as well via subclasses of Texture. For example, to
    create a cube map texture with 6 faces, use the \l CubeMapTexture type.

    When the geometry is being rendered, each location on its surface will be
    transformed to a corresponding location in the texture by transforming and
    interpolating the UV coordinates (texture coordinate) that have been set for
    the mesh's vertexes. The fragment shader program that is being used to render
    the active material will then typically sample the material's texture(s) at
    the given coordinates and use the sampled data in its light calculations.

    \note A Material may use multiple textures to give the desired interaction with
    light in the 3D scene. It can represent the color of each texel on the geometry
    surface, but also other attributes of the surface. For instance, a "normal map"
    can represent the deviation from the geometry normals for each texel on the
    surface, emulating light interaction with finer details on the surface, such
    as cracks or bumps. See \l{Qt Quick 3D - Principled Material Example}{the principled
    material example} for a demonstration of a material with multiple texture maps.

    Texture objects can source image data from:
    \list
    \li an image or texture file by using the \l source property,
    \li a Qt Quick \l Item by using the sourceItem property,
    \li or by setting the \l textureData property to a \l TextureData item
    subclass for defining the custom texture contents.
    \endlist

    The following example maps the image "madewithqt.png" onto the default sphere
    mesh, and scales the UV coordinates to tile the image on the sphere surface.
    \qml
    Model {
        source: "#Sphere"
        materials: [ PrincipledMaterial {
                baseColorMap: Texture {
                    source: "madewithqt.png"
                    scaleU: 4.0
                    scaleV: 4.0
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    \endqml

    The result looks as follows:
    \table
    \header
    \li Original image
    \li Mapped onto a sphere
    \row
    \li \image madewithqt.png
    \li \image spheremap.png
    \endtable

    \qmlproperty url QtQuick3D::Texture::source

    This property holds the location of an image or texture file containing the data used by the
    texture.

    The property is a URL, with the same rules as other source properties, such
    as \l{Image::source}{Image.source}. With Texture, only the \c qrc and \c
    file schemes are supported. When no scheme is present and the value is a
    relative path, it is assumed to be relative to the component's (i.e. the
    \c{.qml} file's) location.

    The source file can have any conventional image file format
    \l{QImageReader::supportedImageFormats()}{supported by Qt}. In addition, Texture supports the
    same \l [QtQuick]{Compressed Texture Files}{compressed texture file types} as QtQuick::Image.

    \note Texture data read from image files such as .png or .jpg involves
    storing the rows of pixels within the texture in an order defined the Qt
    Quick 3D rendering engine. When the source file is a container for -
    possibly compressed - texture data, such transformations cannot happen on
    the pixel data level. Examples of this are .ktx or .pkm files. Instead, the
    Texture implicitly enables vertical flipping in the fragment shader code in
    order to get identical on-screen results. This is controlled by the \l
    autoOrientation property and can be disabled, if desired.

    \note Some texture compression tools may apply automatic vertical mirroring
    (flipping) on the image data. In modern tools this is often an opt-in
    setting. It is important to be aware of the settings used in the asset
    conditioning pipeline, because an unexpectedly flipped texture, and thus
    incorrect texturing of objects, can have its root cause in the asset
    itself, outside the application's and rendering engine's control. When the
    asset requires it, applications can always set the \l flipV property
    themselves.

/*!
    \qmlproperty Item QtQuick3D::Texture::sourceItem

    This property defines a Item to be used as the source of the texture. Using
    this property allows any 2D Qt Quick content to be used as a texture source
    by rendering that item as an offscreen layer.

    If the item is a \l{QQuickItem::textureProvider()}{texture provider}, no
    additional texture is used.

    If this property is set, then the value of \l source will be ignored. A
    Texture should use one method to provide image data, and set only one of
    source, \l sourceItem, or \l textureData.

    \note Currently input events are forwarded to the Item used as a texture
    source only if the user is limited to interacting with one sourceItem
    instance at a time. In other words: you can share the same Item between
    multiple Textures, but then you cannot have multi-touch interaction with
    the same item on multiple textures at the same time. So it's best to use a
    separate 2D subscene instance for each Texture instance, if you expect to
    manipulate interactive items inside.

    \note Using this property in a Texture that is referenced from multiple
    windows is strongly discouraged. This includes usage via
    \l{View3D::importScene}. As the source texture created by this property is
    only accessible by one render thread, attempting to share it between
    multiple QQuickWindow instances is going to fail, unless the \c basic
    render loop of Qt Quick is used instead of the default \c threaded one. See
    \l{Qt Quick Scene Graph} on more information about the Qt Quick render
    loops.

    \note A Texture that contains the results of a Qt Quick offscreen render
    pass will in effect have an Y axis orientation that is different from what
    a Texture that receives its content via the source property uses. When used
    in combination with DefaultMaterial or PrincipledMaterial, this is all
    transparent to the application as the necessary UV transformations are
    applied automatically as long as the autoOrientation property is set to
    true, and so no further action is needed, regardless of how the texture was
    sourced. However, when developing \l{QtQuick3D::CustomMaterial}{custom
    materials} this needs to be kept in mind by the shader code author when
    sampling the texture and working with UV coordinates.

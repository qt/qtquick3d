    \inqmlmodule QtQuick3D
    \brief Lets you configure how a scene is rendered.

    SceneEnvironment defines a set of global properties for how a scene should be rendered.

    \note The QtQuick3D.Helpers module offers an \l ExtendedSceneEnvironment
    type which inherits from SceneEnvironment and adds a number of built-in
    effects on top.

    To use SceneEnvironment or \l ExtendedSceneEnvironment, associate the
    \l{View3D::environment}{environment property} of a View3D with an instance
    of these types. The object can be declared inline, for example like this:

    \qml
        View3D {
            environment: SceneEnvironment {
                antialiasingMode: SceneEnvironment.MSAA
                tonemapMode: SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeFilmic
                backgroundMode: SceneEnvironment.SkyBox
                lightProbe: Texture {
                    source: "panoramic_hdri_background.hdr"
                }
            }
        }
    \endqml

    Alternatively, the environment object can be defined separately. It can
    then be referenced by one or more View3D objects. An example code snippet,
    using \l ExtendedSceneEnvironment this time:

    \qml
        ExtendedSceneEnvironment {
            id: myEnv
            vignetteEnabled: true
        }

        View3D {
            width: parent.width / 2
            environment: myEnv
        }

        View3D {
            width: parent.width / 2
            x: parent.width / 2
            environment: myEnv
        }
    \endqml

    \section1 Feature Overview

    \list

    \li Anti-aliasing settings. See \l{Anti-Aliasing Best Practices} for an
    overview of this topic. The relevant properties are \l antialiasingMode, \l
    antialiasingQuality, \l specularAAEnabled, \l temporalAAEnabled, \l
    temporalAAStrength. In addition, if \l ExtendedSceneEnvironment is used,
    another method is available via
    \l{ExtendedSceneEnvironment::fxaaEnabled}{fxaaEnabled}.

    \li Screen space ambient occlusion. The relevant properties are
    \l aoEnabled, \l aoStrength, \l aoBias, \l aoDistance, \l aoDither,
    \l aoSampleRate, \l aoSoftness.

    \li Clear color, skybox, image-based lighting. For more information on IBL,
    see \l{Using Image-Based Lighting}. The relevant properties are \l
    backgroundMode, \l clearColor, \l lightProbe, \l probeExposure, \l
    probeHorizon, \l probeOrientation, \l skyboxBlurAmount, \l skyBoxCubeMap.

    \li Tonemapping. \l tonemapMode configures the tonemapping method that is
    used to convert the high dynamic range color values to the 0-1 range at the
    end of the graphics pipeline. \l ExtendedSceneEnvironment offers a few
    additional properties, such as
    \l{ExtendedSceneEnvironment::whitePoint}{whitePoint} and
    \l{ExtendedSceneEnvironment::sharpnessAmount}{sharpnessAmount} that can be
    used to tune the tonemapping calculations.

    \li Depth buffer settings. The relevant properties are \l
    depthPrePassEnabled, \l depthTestEnabled.

    \li Post-processing effects. In addition to the built-in post-processing
    effects provided by \l ExtendedSceneEnvironment, applications can provide
    their own custom effects via the \l Effect type. The \l effects property is
    a list of \l Effect instances.

    \li Debug visualization settings, such as wireframe mode or rendering only
    certain color contributions for the materials. This is controlled by the \l
    DebugSettings object referenced from the \l debugSettings property. Most of
    these settings can also be controlled interactively when a \l DebugView
    item is added to the scene.

    \li Fog settings. To enable fog, set an appropriately configured
    \l [QML] Fog object in the \l [QML] fog property.

    \li Lightmap baking settings. When pre-baked lightmaps are used for some
    models in the scene, the \l Lightmapper object set in the \l lightmapper
    property defines the settings used during the baking process.

    \li Scissor settings. To apply a scissor different than the viewport, set
    the \l scissorRect property.

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::antialiasingMode
    \since 5.15

    This property controls the antialiasing mode that is applied when rendering
    the scene.

    Possible values are:
    \value SceneEnvironment.NoAA No antialiasing is applied.
    \value SceneEnvironment.SSAA Supersample antialiasing is applied.
    \value SceneEnvironment.MSAA Multisample antialiasing is applied.
    \value SceneEnvironment.ProgressiveAA Progressive antialiasing is applied.

    The default value is \c SceneEnvironment.NoAA.

    \b Supersampling

    The scene is rendered in a higher resolution, and then scaled down to
    actual resolution.

    \b Pros: High quality. Antialiases all scene content and not just geometry
    silhouettes.

    \b Cons: Usually more expensive than MSAA. Increases video memory usage.
    Supported with View3D items with all renderMode except Inline, but since
    the technique implies rendering to a texture first, enabling SSAA with a
    renderMode of Underlay or Overlay will result in using an intermediate
    texture and render pass that would normally not be needed, meaning the
    performance costs may be more noticeable. It is recommended to use SSAA
    only when the renderMode is the default Offscreen.

    \b Multisampling

    The edges of geometry are super-sampled, resulting in smoother silhouettes.
    This technique has no effect on the materials inside geometry, however.

    \b Pros: Works with any View3D item regardless of the renderMode. Good
    results on geometry silhouettes, where aliasing is often most noticeable;
    works with fast animation without issues. Performance depends purely on the
    system's (GPU) capabilities.

    \b Cons: Does not help with texture or reflection issues. Increases video
    memory usage. Can be expensive to use on less powerful graphics hardware.
    Can be controlled on a per-window basis or for individual View3D items
    depending on the renderMode. When using Underlay/Overlay with an effect
    applied or Offscreen, MSAA can be controlled for each View3D item. On the
    other hand, using Underlay/Overlay without any effect or Inline will make
    MSAA controlled per-window.

    \note For View3D items with a \l{QtQuick3D::View3D::renderMode}{renderMode}
    other than Underlay/Overlay with effects or Offscreen, multisampling can only
    be enabled via the \l{QSurfaceFormat::setSamples()}{QSurfaceFormat} of the
    QQuickWindow or QQuickView. This will then affect all content,
    both 2D and 3D, in that window.

    \b {Progressive antialiasing}

    This property enables and sets the level of progressive antialiasing
    applied to the scene.

    When all content of the scene has stopped moving, the camera is jiggled
    very slightly between frames, and the result of each new frame is blended
    with the previous frames. The more frames you accumulate, the better
    looking the result.

    \b Pros: Provides great results when all content in the scene is standing still.

    \b Cons: Does not take effect if any visual changes are occurring.
    Expensive due to having to accumulate and blend. Increases video memory
    usage.

    \note Progressing antialiasing is not currently supported with multiview
    rendering, and should not be used in VR/AR applications.

    See \l{Anti-Aliasing Best Practices} for further discussion on
    anti-aliasing methods.

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::antialiasingQuality
    \since 5.15

    This property sets the level of antialiasing applied to the scene.
    Behavior depends on used antialiasingMode. With antialiasingMode
    property set to \c NoAA this property doesn't have an effect.

    Possible values are:
    \value SceneEnvironment.Medium
    SSAA: Antialiasing uses 1.2x supersampling resolution.\br
    MSAA: Antialiasing uses 2 samples per pixel.\br
    ProgressiveAA: Antialiasing uses 2 frames for final image.

    SSAA: Antialiasing uses 1.5x supersampling resolution.\br
    MSAA: Antialiasing uses 4 samples per pixel.\br
    ProgressiveAA: Antialiasing uses 4 frames for final image.

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::backgroundMode

    This property controls if and how the background of the scene should be
    cleared.

    \note The clearing of the color buffer backing the View 3D does not always
    happen: depending on the \l{QtQuick3D::View3D::renderMode}{renderMode}
    property the View3D may not perform any clearing on its own, in which case
    \c{SceneEnvironment.Transparent} and \c{SceneEnvironment.Color} have no
    effect. Only the default \c Offscreen \l{View3D::renderMode}{render mode}
    (rendering into a texture) supports all clearing modes. With the \c
    Underlay mode, use \l{QQuickWindow::setColor()} or
    \l[QtQuick]{Window::color}{Window.color} to control the clear color for the
    Qt Quick scene. SkyBox is handled differently, as it implies drawing actual
    geometry, so that works identically across all render modes.

    \value SceneEnvironment.Transparent
        The scene is cleared to be transparent. This is useful to render 3D content on top of another item.
        This mode has no effect when the View3D is using a renderMode of Underlay or Overlay without any
        post processing enabled.
    \value SceneEnvironment.Color
        The scene is cleared with the color specified by the clearColor property.
        This mode has no effect when the View3D is using a renderMode of Underlay or Overlay without any
        post processing enabled.
    \value SceneEnvironment.SkyBox
        The scene will not be cleared, but instead a SkyBox or Skydome will be rendered. The SkyBox
        is defined using the HDRI map defined in the lightProbe property.
    \value SceneEnvironment.SkyBoxCubeMap
        The scene will not be cleared, but instead a SkyBox or Skydome will be rendered. The SkyBox
        is defined using the cubemap defined in the skyBoxCubeMap property.

    The default value is \c SceneEnvironment.Transparent

    Take the following example. The Suzanne model is expected to be
    pre-processed with the \c balsam tool and is sourced from the
    \l{https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models}{glTF Sample Models}
    repository.

                }

                DirectionalLight {
                }

                Suzanne {
                    scale: Qt.vector3d(50, 50, 50)
                    z: -500
                }

                PerspectiveCamera {

                }
            }

    \endqml

    Using image-based lighting in additional to the DirectionalLight and also
    using the light probe texture as the skybox gives us the following:

    or QQuickView hosting the 2D and 3D scene. Lighting is based on the
    DirectionalLight only.

    \qmlproperty float QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::aoStrength

    This property defines the amount of ambient occulusion applied. Ambient
    occulusion is a form of approximated global illumination which causes
    non-directional self-shadowing where objects are close together.
    A value of 100 causes full darkness shadows; lower values cause the
    shadowing to appear lighter. A value of 0 disables ambient occlusion
    entirely, improving performance at a cost to the visual realism of 3D
    objects rendered in the scene.

    All values other than 0 have the same impact to the performance.

    The default value is 0.0. The maximum value is 100.0.

    A value of 0 is equivalent to setting \l aoEnabled to false.

/*!
    \qmlproperty QtQuick3D::Texture QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::lightProbe

    This property defines an image used to light the scene, either instead of,
    or in addition to standard lights.

    The image is preferably a high-dynamic range image or a \l{Pre-generating
    IBL cubemap}{pre-generated cubemap}. Pre-baking provides significant
    performance improvements at run time, because no time is spent on filtering
    and mipmap generation. If the source is a .hdr or other image, the GPU-based
    pre-processing happens at run time after loading the image file, and that
    can be potentially time consuming, in particular on embedded and mobile
    hardware. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that applications
    pre-process .hdr images at latest at build time, as described
    \l{Pre-generating IBL cubemap}{here}.

    \note Using a Texture with \l{Texture::sourceItem}{sourceItem} is not
    supported in combination with this property. Pre-filtering of all mip
    levels for dynamic Qt Quick content is typically not reasonable in practice
    due to performance implications.

    For more information on image-based lighting, see \l{Using Image-Based Lighting}.

    \note The light probe texture, when the property is set to a valid Texture,
    is used for lighting regardless of the \l backgroundMode. However, when \l
    backgroundMode is set to \c{SceneEnvironment.SkyBox}, the texture is also
    used to render the scene background as a skybox.

    The examples below were generated with varying the \l backgroundMode in the
    environment of the following scene. The scene has no DirectionLight,
    PointLight, or SpotLight. All lighting is based on the panoramic HDRI
    image.

    \image sceneenvironment_lightprobe_2.jpg

    Switching the backgroundMode to \c{SceneEnvironment.Transparent} would give us:

    \image sceneenvironment_lightprobe_transparent.jpg
    \image sceneenvironment_lightprobe_transparent_2.jpg

    Here the lighting of the 3D scene is the same as before, meaning the
    materials use the light probe in the lighting calculations the same way as
    before, but there is no skybox rendered. The background is white since that
    is the default clear color of the QQuickWindow hosting the 2D and 3D scene.

    It is valid to set the lightProbe property value back to the default null.
    This unassigns the previously associated texture. For example, let's use
    the Delete key to dynamically toggle between image-based lighting with a
    skybox, and no image-based lighting with a fixed clear color for the
    background:

    \qml
        environment: ExtendedSceneEnvironment {
            id: env

            backgroundMode: SceneEnvironment.SkyBox
            lightProbe: iblTex

            tonemapMode: SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeFilmic
            sharpnessAmount: 0.4

            glowEnabled: true
            glowStrength: 1.25
            glowBloom: 0.25
            glowBlendMode: ExtendedSceneEnvironment.GlowBlendMode.Additive
        }

        Texture {
            id: iblTex
            source: "00455_OpenfootageNET_field_low.hdr"
        }

        focus: true
        Keys.onDeletePressed: {
            if (env.backgroundMode == SceneEnvironment.SkyBox) {
                env.backgroundMode = SceneEnvironment.Color;
                env.clearColor = "green";
                env.lightProbe = null;
            } else {
                env.backgroundMode = SceneEnvironment.SkyBox;
                env.lightProbe = iblTex;
            }
        }
    \endqml

    Pressing Delete gives the following result. Remember that the scene used
    here has no lights so all 3D models appear completely black.

    \image sceneenvironment_lightprobe_null.jpg
    \image sceneenvironment_lightprobe_null_2.jpg

    While lightProbe is commonly used in combination with Texture instances
    that source their data from an image file (typically .hdr or .ktx), it can
    also makes sense to associate with a Texture that uses in-memory,
    \l{Texture::textureData}{procedurally generated image data}. A prime
    example of this is a Texture where the image data is generated by \l
    ProceduralSkyTextureData from the QtQuick3D.Helpers module:

    \qml
            backgroundMode: SceneEnvironment.SkyBox
            lightProbe: Texture {
                textureData: ProceduralSkyTextureData {
                }
            }
    \endqml

    This gives us a procedurally generated HDR skybox texture that is now used
    both as the skybox and for image-based lighting:

    The default value is \c true. By default the renderer classifies the objects
    in the scene either as \c opaque or as \c semi-transparent. The objects
    (sub-meshes with the associated material) in the \c opaque list are rendered
    first, with depth testing and depth write enabled, providing optimal
    Z-culling for typical 3D objects that have no semi-transparent regions. The
    objects in the \c semi-transparent list are rendered with depth write
    disabled, although still with depth testing enabled (to test against the
    opaque objects), in back to front order (sorted based on their center point's
    distance from the camera). This allows correct blending ("see through") for
    3D objects that involve semi-transparent regions on their surface, either
    due to the \l{Node::opacity}{node opacity} or due to some color or texture
    map in the material.

    When this property is set to \c {false}, the Z-buffer is not written and
    tested against, the depth test is skipped, and all objects, including fully
    opaque ones, are rendered in one go, sorted back to front.

    Setting this property to \c false should be rarely needed. It can be useful
    in scenes where it is known that there is little benefit in the two-round
    approach because either there are very few opaque objects, or they are
    transformed in a way that a single back to front sorted pass performs
    better.

    \note Setting this property to \c false may cause rendering errors in
    certain scenes. In addition, some features, such as shadows, ambient
    occlusion, \c SCREEN_TEXTURE and \c DEPTH_TEXTURE in custom materials and
    effects, will not behave correctly without enabling depth buffer usage.

    \note This flag has no control over the presence of a depth or

    get the depth buffer pre-filled before issuing draw calls for the main
    rendering passes.

    This can improve performance depending on the scene contents. It is
    typically scenes with lots of overlapping objects and expensive fragment
    shading that benefit from this. At the same time, it is worth noting that
    the renderer performs front to back sorting for opaque objects, which in
    itself helps reducing unnecessary fragment shading, and therefore the
    Z-prepass does not always bring significant improvements.

    On GPUs that use a tiled rendering architecture, which is common in mobile
    and embedded systems, it is recommended to set this to \c false.

    \qmlproperty enumeration QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::tonemapMode

    This property defines how colors are tonemapped before rendering. All
    rendering in Qt Quick 3D is performed in linear color space and can in
    many cases lead to generating color values that are not displayable. The
    tonemapMode determines the technique that is used to remap colors into a
    displayable range.

    The default value is \c SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeLinear

    \value SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeNone
        All Tonemapping is bypassed. This mode is useful when performing post
        processing effects.
    \value SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeLinear
        Linear tonemapping is applied. Colors are gamma corrected and returned
        in sRGB color space.
    \value SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeAces
        Academy Color Encoding System tonemapping is applied.
    \value SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeHejlDawson
        Hejl-Dawson tonemapping is applied.
    \value SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeFilmic
        Filmic tonemapping is applied.

    See \l{ExtendedSceneEnvironment::tonemapMode}{ExtendedSceneEnvironment} for
    an example of these different modes.

    \note When using post-processing effects, most effects expect untonemapped
    linear color data. With application-provided, custom effects implemented
    via the \l Effect type, it is important to know that starting with Qt 6.5
    effects can safely assume that they work with linear color data, and
    tonemapping is performed automatically on the output of the last effect in
    the chain. If there is a need to customize tonemapping completely, consider
    setting the \c SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeNone value to disable the
    built-in tonemapper, and perform the appropriate adjustments on the color
    value in the last effect in the chain instead. This does not apply to the
    built-in effects of \l ExtendedSceneEnvironment, because those
    automatically take care of proper tonemapping regardless of what
    combination of built-in effects are enabled in the environment.

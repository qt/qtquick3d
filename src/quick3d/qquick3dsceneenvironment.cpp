    \qmlproperty enumeration QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::antialiasingMode
    \since 5.15

    This property controls the antialiasing mode that is applied when rendering
    the scene.

    Possible values are:
    \value SceneEnvironment.NoAA No antialiasing is applied.
    \value SceneEnvironment.SSAA Supersample antialiasing is applied.
    \value SceneEnvironment.MSAA Multisample antialiasing is applied.
    \value SceneEnvironment.ProgressiveAA Progressive antialiasing is applied.

    The default value is \c SceneEnvironment.NoAA.

    \b Supersampling

    The scene is rendered in a higher resolution, and then scaled down to
    actual resolution.

    \b Pros: High quality. Antialiases all scene content and not just geometry
    silhouettes.

    \b Cons: Usually more expensive than MSAA. Increases video memory usage.
    Only supported with View3D items with renderMode set to Offscreen as the
    technique implies rendering to a texture first.

    \b Multisampling

    The edges of geometry are super-sampled, resulting in smoother silhouettes.
    This technique has no effect on the materials inside geometry, however.

    \b Pros: Works with any View3D item regardless of the renderMode. Good
    results on geometry silhouettes, where aliasing is often most noticeable;
    works with fast animation without issues. Performance depends purely on the
    system's (GPU) capabilities.

    \b Cons: Does not help with texture or reflection issues. Increases video
    memory usage. Can be expensive to use on less powerful graphics hardware.
    When using View3D items with a renderMode other than Offscreen, MSAA can
    only be controlled on a per-window basis, it cannot be enabled or disabled
    separately for the individual View3D items.

    \note For View3D items with a \l{QtQuick3D::View3D::renderMode}{renderMode}
    other than Offscreen, multisampling can only be enabled via the
    \l{QSurfaceFormat::setSamples()}{QSurfaceFormat} of the QQuickWindow or
    QQuickView. This will then affect all content, both 2D and 3D, in that window.

    \b {Progressive antialiasing}

    This property enables and sets the level of progressive antialiasing
    applied to the scene.

    When all content of the scene has stopped moving, the camera is jiggled
    very slightly between frames, and the result of each new frame is blended
    with the previous frames. The more frames you accumulate, the better
    looking the result.

    \b Pros: Provides great results when all content in the scene is standing still.

    \b Cons: Does not take effect if any visual changes are occurring.
    Expensive due to having to accumulate and blend. Increases video memory
    usage.

    \qmlproperty enumeration QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::backgroundMode

    This property controls if and how the background of the scene should be
    cleared.

    \note Clearing does not always happen: depending on the
    \l{QtQuick3D::View3D::renderMode}{renderMode} property the View3D may not
    perform any clearing on its own, in which case
    SceneEnvironment.Transparent and SceneEnvironment.Color have no effect.
    Only the Offscreen mode (rendering into a texture) supports all clearing
    modes. With the Underlay mode, use \l{QQuickWindow::setColor()} or
    \l[QtQuick]{Window::color}{Window.color} to control the clear color for
    the Qt Quick scene. SkyBox is handled differently, as it implies drawing
    actual geometry, so that works identically across all render modes.

    \value SceneEnvironment.Transparent
        The scene is cleared to be transparent. This is useful to render 3D content on top of another item.
        This mode has no effect when the View3D is using a renderMode of Underlay or Overlay.
    \value SceneEnvironment.Color
        The scene is cleared with the color specified by the clearColor property.
        This mode has no effect when the View3D is using a renderMode of Underlay or Overlay.
    \value SceneEnvironment.SkyBox
        The scene will not be cleared, but instead a SkyBox or Skydome will be rendered. The SkyBox
        is defined using the HDRI map defined in the lightProbe property.

    A value of 100 causes full darkness shadows; lower values cause the

    The image is preferably a high-dynamic range image or a \l{Pre-generating
    IBL cubemap}{pre-generated cubemap}. Pre-baking provides significant
    performance improvements at run time, because no time is spent on filtering
    and mipmap generation. If the source is a .hdr or other image, the GPU-based
    pre-processing happens at run time after loading the image file, and that
    can be potentially time consuming, in particular on embedded and mobile
    hardware. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that applications
    pre-process .hdr images at latest at build time, as described
    \l{Pre-generating IBL cubemap}{here}.

    \note Using a Texture with \l{Texture::sourceItem}{sourceItem} is not
    supported in combination with this property. Pre-filtering of all mip
    levels for dynamic Qt Quick content is typically not reasonable in practice
    due to performance implications.

    from the lower half). This property is useful for accounting for a ground
    plane that would have the effect of obscuring the reflection of the light
    probe from the ground. This is necessary because light probe contributions
    come directily from the image without consideration for the content of the
    scene.

    The expected value range for the probeHorizon property is between 0.0
    and 1.0. Any value outside of this range will be clamped to the
    expected range.

    By default probeHorizon is set to 0.0 which means the whole light probe

    \qmlproperty bool QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::depthTestEnabled

    The default value is \c true. By default the renderer classifies the objects
    in the scene either as \c opaque or as \c semi-transparent. The objects
    (sub-meshes with the associated material) in the \c opaque list are rendered
    first, with depth testing and depth write enabled, providing optimal
    Z-culling for typical 3D objects that have no semi-transparent regions. The
    objects in the \c semi-transparent list are rendered with depth write
    disabled, although still with depth testing enabled (to test against the
    opaque objects), in back to front order (sorted based on their center point's
    distance from the camera). This allows correct blending ("see through") for
    3D objects that involve semi-transparent regions on their surface, either
    due to the \l{Node::opacity}{node opacity} or due to some color or texture
    map in the material.

    When this property is set to \c {false}, the Z-buffer is not written and
    tested against, the depth test is skipped, and all objects, including fully
    opaque ones, are rendered in one go, sorted back to front.

    Setting this property to \c false should be rarely needed. It can be useful
    in scenes where it is known that there is little benefit in the two-round
    approach because either there are very few opaque objects, or they are
    transformed in a way that a single back to front sorted pass performs
    better.

    \note Setting this property to \c false may cause rendering errors in
    certain scenes. In addition, some features, such as shadows, ambient
    occlusion, \c SCREEN_TEXTURE and \c DEPTH_TEXTURE in custom materials and
    effects, will not behave correctly without enabling depth buffer usage.

    \note This flag has no control over the presence of a depth or
    depth-stencil buffer. Such buffers may still be allocated even when this is
    set to \c false.

    \qmlproperty bool QtQuick3D::SceneEnvironment::depthPrePassEnabled

    When enabled, the renderer performs a Z-prepass for opaque objects, meaning
    it renders them with a simple shader and color write disabled in order to
    get the depth buffer pre-filled before issuing draw calls for the main
    rendering passes.

    This can improve performance depending on the scene contents. It is
    typically scenes with lots of overlapping objects and expensive fragment
    shading that benefit from this. At the same time, it is worth noting that
    the renderer performs front to back sorting for opaque objects, which in
    itself helps reducing unnecessary fragment shading, and therefore the
    Z-prepass does not always bring significant improvements.

    On GPUs that use a tiled rendering architecture, which is common in mobile
    and embedded systems, it is recommended to set this to \c false.

    The default value is \c false.

    This property defines how colors are tonemapped before rendering. All

    many cases lead to generating color values that are not displayable. The
    tonemapMode determines the technique that is used to remap colors into a
    displayable range.

    The default value is \c SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeLinear

    \value SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeNone
        All Tonemapping is bypassed. This mode is useful when performing post
        processing effects.

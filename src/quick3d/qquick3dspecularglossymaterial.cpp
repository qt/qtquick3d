    \qmltype SpecularGlossyMaterial
    \inherits Material
    \inqmlmodule QtQuick3D
    \brief Lets you define a material for 3D items using the specular/glossiness workflow.

    Before a Model can be rendered in a scene, it must have at least one material attached
    to it that describes how the mesh should be shaded. The SpecularGlossyMaterial is a PBR
    specular/glossiness material that aims at being an easy to use material with a minimal
    set of parameters.
    In addition to having few parameters, all input values are strictly normalized
    between 0 and 1 and have sensible defaults, meaning even without changing any values,
    the material can be used to shader a model. For an introduction on how the
    different properties of the SpecularGlossyMaterial affects how a model is shaded,
    see the \l{Qt Quick 3D - Principled Material Example}{Principled Material example} which
    provides a mode for using the Specular/Glossy workflow.

    Alternatively to use the metallic/roughness workflow instead use \l {PrincipledMaterial}.

    \section1 Specular/Glossiness workflow

    The SpecularGlossyMaterial provides a way to create materials using a specular/glossiness
    type workflow. The main properties of the material is controlled through
    the \l {SpecularGlossyMaterial::specularMap} {specular},
    \l {SpecularGlossyMaterial::glossinessMap} {glossiness},
    and \l {SpecularGlossyMaterial::albedoMap} {albedo} properties.

    \section2 Specular

    The \l {SpecularGlossyMaterial::specularMap} {specularColor} property describes the specular
    amount and color of an object's surface. For reflective materials the main color
    contribution, comes from this property.

    \section2 Glossiness

    The \l {SpecularGlossyMaterial::glossinessMap} {glossiness} of a material describes the
    condition of an object's surface. A high \c glossiness value means the object has a smooth
    surface and therefore be more reflective then a material with a lower \c glossiness value.

    \section2 Albedo

    The \l {SpecularGlossyMaterial::albedoMap} {albedoColor} property describes the diffuse color
    of the material, and unlike the \l {PrincipledMaterial}'s base color, the albedo
    does not contain any information about the material reflectance. That means that for
    reflective surfaces the albedo's color value should be set to a black tint, as that
    will allow for the specular color to contribute.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration SpecularGlossyMaterial::lighting

    This property defines which lighting method is used when generating this
    material.

    The default value is \c SpecularGlossyMaterial.FragmentLighting

    When using \c SpecularGlossyMaterial.FragmentLighting, diffuse and specular lighting is
    calculated for each rendered pixel. Certain effects (such as a Fresnel or normal map) require
    \c SpecularGlossyMaterial.FragmentLighting to work.

    When using \c SpecularGlossyMaterial.NoLighting no lighting is calculated. This
    mode is (predictably) very fast, and is quite effective when image maps are
    used that you do not need to be shaded by lighting. All other shading
    properties except albedo values, alpha values, and vertex colors will be
    ignored.

    \value SpecularGlossyMaterial.NoLighting
    \value SpecularGlossyMaterial.FragmentLighting
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration SpecularGlossyMaterial::blendMode

    This property determines how the colors of the model rendered blends with
    those behind it.

    \value SpecularGlossyMaterial.SourceOver Default blend mode. Opaque objects
    occlude objects behind them. This default mode does not guarantee alpha
    blending in the rendering pipeline on its own for models that use this
    material, but rather makes the decision dependent on a number of factors:
    if the object's and material's total opacity is \c{1.0}, there is no
    opacity map in the material, and \l alphaMode is not set to a value that
    enforces alpha blending, then the model is treated as opaque, meaning it is
    rendered with depth testing and depth write enabled, together with other
    opaque objects, with blending disabled. Otherwise the model is treated as
    semi-transparent, and is rendered after the opaque objects, together with
    other semi-transparent objects in a back-to-front order based on their
    center's distance from the camera, with alpha blending enabled.

    \value SpecularGlossyMaterial.Screen Colors are blended using an inverted
    multiply, producing a lighter result. This blend mode is order-independent;
    if you are using semi-opaque objects and experiencing 'popping' as faces or
    models sort differently, using Screen blending is one way to produce
    results without popping.

    \value SpecularGlossyMaterial.Multiply Colors are blended using a multiply,
    producing a darker result. This blend mode is also order-independent.

    \qmlproperty real SpecularGlossyMaterial::glossiness

    This property controls the size of the specular highlight generated from
    lights, and the clarity of reflections in general. Smaller values increase
    the roughness, softening specular highlights and blurring reflections.
    The range is [0.0, 1.0]. The default value is \c 1.0.

    If an emissive map is set, the x, y, and z components are used as factors
    (multipliers) for the R, G and B channels of the texture, respectively.
    The default value is (0, 0, 0) and it means no emissive contribution at all.

    \note Setting the lightingMode to DefaultMaterial.NoLighting means emissive
    Factor does not have an effect on the scene.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty Texture SpecularGlossyMaterial::occlusionMap

    This property defines a texture used to determine how much indirect light the different areas of the
    material should receive. Values are expected to be linear from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 means no indirect lighting
    and 1.0 means the effect of the indirect lighting is left unchanged.

    \sa occlusionAmount
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration SpecularGlossyMaterial::occlusionChannel

    This property defines the texture channel used to read the occlusion value from occlusionMap.
    The default value is \c Material.R.

    \value Material.R Read value from texture R channel.
    \value Material.G Read value from texture G channel.
    \value Material.B Read value from texture B channel.
    \value Material.A Read value from texture A channel.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration SpecularGlossyMaterial::alphaMode

    This property specifies how the alpha color value from \l albedoColor and the
    alpha channel of a \l{albedoMap}{albedo map} are used.

    \note The alpha cutoff test only considers the albedo color alpha. \l opacity
    and \l [QtQuick3D] {Node::opacity} are not taken into account there.

    \note When sampling an albedo color map, the effective alpha value is the
    sampled alpha multiplied by the \l albedoColor alpha.

    \value SpecularGlossyMaterial.Default No test is applied, the effective alpha
    value is passed on as-is. Note that a \l albedoColor or \l albedoMap alpha
    less than \c 1.0 does not automatically imply alpha blending, the object
    with the material may still be treated as opaque, if no other relevant
    properties (such as, an opacity less than 1, the presence of an opacity
    map, or a non-default \l blendMode value) trigger treating the object as
    semi-transparent. To ensure alpha blending happens regardless of any other
    object or material property, set \c Blend instead.

    \value SpecularGlossyMaterial.Blend No cutoff test is applied, but guarantees
    that alpha blending happens. The object with this material will therefore
    never be treated as opaque by the renderer.

    \value SpecularGlossyMaterial.Opaque No cutoff test is applied and the rendered
    object is assumed to be fully opaque, meaning the alpha values in the
    vertex color, albedo color, and albedo color map are ignored and a value of 1.0
    is substituted instead. This mode does not guarantee alpha blending does
    not happen. If relevant properties (such as, an opacity less than 1, an
    opacity map, or a non-default \l blendMode) say so, then the object will
    still be treated as semi-transparent by the rendering pipeline, just like
    with the \c Default alphaMode.

    \value SpecularGlossyMaterial.Mask A test based on \l alphaCutoff is applied.
    If the effective alpha value falls below \l alphaCutoff, the fragment is
    changed to fully transparent and is discarded (with all implications of
    discarding: the depth buffer is not written for that fragment). Otherwise
    the alpha is changed to 1.0, so that the fragment will become fully opaque.
    When it comes to alpha blending, the behavior of this mode is identical to
    \c Opaque, regardless of the cutoff test's result. This means that the
    \l{https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#alpha-coverage}{glTF
    2 spec's alpha coverage} Implementation Notes are fulfilled. Objects with
    alpha cutoff tests can also cast shadows since they behave like opaque
    objects by default, unless the relevant properties (such as, an opacity
    less than 1, an opacity map, or a non-default \l blendMode) imply otherwise
    (in which case casting shadows will not be possible).

    \sa alphaCutoff, blendMode
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real SpecularGlossyMaterial::alphaCutoff

    The alphaCutoff property can be used to specify the cutoff value when using
    the \l{alphaMode}{Mask alphaMode}. Fragments where the alpha value falls
    below the threshold will be rendered fully transparent (\c{0.0} for all
    color channels). When the alpha value is equal or greater than the cutoff
    value, the color will not be affected in any way.

    The default value is 0.5.

    \sa alphaMode
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real SpecularGlossyMaterial::pointSize

    This property determines the size of the points rendered, when the geometry
    is using a primitive type of points. The default value is 1.0. This
    property is not relevant when rendering other types of geometry, such as,
    triangle meshes.

    \warning Point sizes other than 1 may not be supported at run time,
    depending on the underyling graphics API. For example, setting a size other
    than 1 has no effect with Direct 3D.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real SpecularGlossyMaterial::lineWidth

    This property determines the width of the lines rendered, when the geometry
    is using a primitive type of lines or line strips. The default value is
    1.0. This property is not relevant when rendering other types of geometry,
    such as, triangle meshes.

    \warning Line widths other than 1 may not be suported at run time,
    depending on the underlying graphics API. When that is the case, the
    request to change the width is ignored. For example, none of the following
    can be expected to support wide lines: Direct3D, Metal, OpenGL with core
    profile contexts.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty Texture SpecularGlossyMaterial::heightMap

    This property defines a texture used to determine the height the texture
    will be displaced when rendered through the use of Parallax Mapping. Values
    are expected to be linear from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 means no displacement
    and 1.0 means means maximum displacement.

/*!
    \qmlproperty real SpecularGlossyMaterial::heightAmount

    This property contains the factor used to modify the values from the
    \l heightMap texture. The value should be between 0.0 to 1.0. The default
    value is 0.0 which means that height displacement will be disabled, even
    if a height map set.

/*!
    \qmlproperty int SpecularGlossyMaterial::minHeightMapSamples

    This property defines the minimum number of samples used for performing
    Parallex Occlusion Mapping using the \l heightMap. The minHeightMapSamples
    value is the number of samples of the heightMap are used when looking directly
    at a surface (when the camera view is perpendicular to the fragment).
    The default value is 8.

    The actual number of samples used for each fragment will be between
    \l minHeightMapSamples and \l maxHeightMapSamples depending on the angle of
    the camera relative to the surface being rendered.

    \note This value should only be adjusted to fine tune materials using a

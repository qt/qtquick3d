    \qmltype Model
    \inherits Node
    \inqmlmodule QtQuick3D
    \brief Lets you load a 3D model data.

    The Model item makes it possible to load a mesh and modify how its shaded, by adding materials
    to it. For a model to be renderable, it needs at least a mesh and a material.

    \section1 Mesh format and built-in primitives

    The model can load static meshes from storage or one of the built-in primitive types.
    The mesh format used is a run-time format that's native to the engine, but additional formats are
    supported through the asset import tool \l {Balsam Asset Import Tool}{Balsam}.

    The built-in primitives can be loaded by setting the \c source property to one of these values:
    \c {#Rectangle, #Sphere, #Cube, #Cylinder or #Cone}.

    \qml
    Model {
        source: "#Sphere"
    }
    \endqml

    \section2 Custom geometry

    In addition to using static meshes, you can implement a
    \l {QQuick3DGeometry}{custom geometry} provider that provides the model with
    custom vertex data at run-time. See the
    \l {Qt Quick 3D - Custom Geometry Example}{Custom Geometry Example} for an
    example on how to create and use a custom material with your model.

    \section1 Materials

    A model can consist of several sub-meshes, each of which can have its own
    material. The sub-mesh uses a material from the \l{materials} list,
    corresponding to its index. If the number of materials is less than the
    sub-meshes, the last material in the list is used for subsequent sub-meshes.
    This is demonstrated in the
    \l {Qt Quick 3D - Sub-mesh Example}{Sub-mesh example}.

    You can use the following materials with the model item:
    \l {PrincipledMaterial}, \l {DefaultMaterial}, and \l {CustomMaterial}.

    \section1 Picking

    \e Picking is the process of sending a ray through the scene from some
    starting position to find which models intersect with the ray. In
    Qt Quick 3D, the ray is normally sent from the view using 2D coordinates
    resulting from a touch or mouse event. If a model was hit by the ray,
    \l {PickResult} will be returned with a handle to the model and information
    about where the ray hit the model. For models that use
    \l {QQuick3DGeometry}{custom geometry}, the picking is less accurate than
    for static mesh data, as picking is only done against the model's
    \l {bounds}{bounding volume}. If the ray goes through more than one model,
    the closest \l {Model::pickable}{pickable} model is selected.

    Note that for models to be \l {Model::pickable}{pickable}, their
    \l {Model::pickable}{pickable} property must be set to \c true. For more
    information, see \l {Qt Quick 3D - Picking example}.

    value is 1024, indicating 1024x1024 as the base size. The actual size of
    the lightmap texture is likely to be different, often bigger, depending on
    the mesh.

    For simpler, smaller meshes, or when it is known that using a bigger
    lightmap is unnecessary, the value can be set to something smaller, for
    example, 512 or 256.

    The minimum value is 128.

    This setting applies both to persistently stored and for intermediate,
    partial lightmaps. When baking lightmaps, all models that have \l
    usedInBakedLighting enabled are part of the path-traced scene. Thus all of
    them need to have lightmap UV unwrapping performed and the rasterization
    steps necessary to compute direct lighting which then can be taken into
    account for indirect light bounces in the scene. However, for models that
    just contribute to, but do not store a lightmap the default value is often
    sufficient. Fine-tuning is more relevant for models that store and then use
    the generated lightmaps.

    This property is relevant only when baking lightmaps. It has no effect
    afterwards, when using the generated lightmaps during rendering.

    Models that have lightmap UV data pre-generated during asset import time
    (e.g. via the balsam tool) will ignore this property because the lightmap
    UV unwrapping and the lightmap size hint evaluation have already been done,
    and will not be performed again during lightmap baking.

    associated lightmap. The default value is null.

    \note When the intention is to generate a persistently stored lightmap for
    a Model, both bakedLightmap and \l usedInBakedLighting must be set on it,
    in order to indicate that the Model not only participates in the
    lightmapped scene, but also wants a full lightmap to be baked and stored.

    For more information on how to bake lightmaps, see the \l Lightmapper
    documentation.

    This property is relevant both when baking and when using lightmaps. A
    consistent state between the baking run and the subsequent runs that use
    the generated data is essential. For example, changing the lightmap key
    will make it impossible to load the previously generated data. An exception
    is \l {BakedLightmap::}{enabled}, which can be used to dynamically toggle
    the usage of lightmaps (outside of the baking run), but be aware that the

/*!
    \qmlproperty real Model::levelOfDetailBias
    \since 6.5

    This property changes the size the model needs to be when rendered before the
    automatic level of detail meshes are used. Each generated level of detail
    mesh contains an ideal size value that each level should be shown, which is
    a ratio of how much of the rendered scene will be that mesh. A model that
    represents only a few pixels on screen will not require the full geometry
    to look correct, so a lower level of detail mesh will be used instead in
    this case. This value is a bias to the ideal value such that a value smaller
    than \c 1.0 will require an even smaller rendered size before switching to
    a lesser level of detail. Values above \c 1.0 will lead to lower levels of detail
    being used sooner. A value of \c 0.0 will disable the usage of levels of detail
    completely.

    The default value is \c 1.0

    \note This property will only have an effect when the Model's geometry contains
    levels of detail.

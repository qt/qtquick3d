    \instantiates QQuick3DEffect
    \brief Base component for creating a post-processing effect.

    The Effect type allows the user to implement their own post-processing
    effects for QtQuick3D.

    \section1 Post-processing effects

    A post-processing effect is conceptually very similar to Qt Quick's \l
    ShaderEffect item. When an effect is present, the scene is rendered into a
    separate texture first. The effect is then applied by drawing a textured
    quad to the main render target, depending on the
    \l{View3D::renderMode}{render mode} of the View3D. The effect can provide a
    vertex shader, a fragment shader, or both. Effects are always applied on the
    entire scene, per View3D.

    Effects are associated with the \l SceneEnvironment in the
    \l{SceneEnvironment::effects} property. The property is a list: effects can
    be chained together; they are applied in the order they are in the list,
    using the previous step's output as the input to the next one, with the last
    effect's output defining the contents of the View3D.

    \note \l SceneEnvironment and \l ExtendedSceneEnvironment provide a set of
    built-in effects, such as depth of field, glow/bloom, lens flare, color
    grading, and vignette. Always consider first if these are sufficient for
    the application's needs, and prefer using the built-in facilities instead
    of implementing a custom post-processing effect.

    Effects are similar to \l{CustomMaterial}{custom materials} in many
    ways. However, a custom material is associated with a model and is
    responsible for the shading of that given mesh. Whereas an effect's vertex
    shader always gets a quad (for example, two triangles) as its input, while
    its fragment shader samples the texture with the scene's content.

    Unlike custom materials, effects support multiple passes. For many effects
    this it not necessary, and when there is a need to apply multiple effects,
    identical results can often be achieved by chaining together multiple
    effects in \l{SceneEnvironment::effects}{the SceneEnvironment}. This is
    demonstrated by the \l{Qt Quick 3D - Custom Effect Example}{Custom Effect
    example} as well. However, passes have the possibility to request additional
    color buffers (texture), and specify which of these additional buffers they
    output to. This allows implementing more complex image processing techniques
    since subsequent passes can then use one or more of these additional
    buffers, plus the original scene's content, as their input. If necessary,
    these additional buffers can have an extended lifetime, meaning their
    content is preserved between frames, which allows implementing effects that
    rely on accumulating content from multiple frames, such as, motion blur.

    When compared to Qt Quick's 2D ShaderEffect, the 3D post-processing effects
    have the advantage of being able to work with depth buffer data, as well as
    the ability to implement multiple passes with intermediate buffers. In
    addition, the texture-related capabilities are extended: Qt Quick 3D allows
    more fine-grained control over filtering modes, and allows effects to work
    with texture formats other than RGBA8, for example, floating point formats.

    \note Post-processing effects are currently available when the View3D
    has its \l{View3D::renderMode}{renderMode} set to \c Offscreen,
    \c Underlay or \c Overlay. Effects will not be rendered for \c Inline mode.

    \note When using post-processing effects, the application-provided shaders
    should expect linear color data without tonemapping applied. The
    tonemapping that is performed during the main render pass (or during skybox
    rendering, if there is a skybox) when
    \l{SceneEnvironment::tonemapMode}{tonemapMode} is set to a value other than
    \c SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeNone, is automatically disabled when there
    is at least one post-processing effect specified in the SceneEnvironment.
    The last effect in the chain (more precisely, the last pass of the last
    effect in the chain) will automatically get its fragment shader amended to
    perform the same tonemapping the main render pass would.

    \note Effects that perform their own tonemapping should be used in a
    SceneEnvironment that has the built-in tonemapping disabled by setting
    \l{SceneEnvironment::tonemapMode}{tonemapMode} to \c
    SceneEnvironment.TonemapModeNone.

    \note By default the texture used as the effects' input is created with a
    floating point texture format, such as 16-bit floating point RGBA. The
    output texture's format is the same since by default it follows the input
    format. This can be overridden using \l Buffer and an empty name. The
    default RGBA16F is useful because it allows working with non-tonemapped
    linear data without having the color values outside the 0-1 range clamped.

    \section1 Exposing data to the shaders

    Like with CustomMaterial or ShaderEffect, the dynamic properties of an
    Effect object can be changed and animated using the usual QML and Qt Quick
    facilities, and the values are exposed to the shaders automatically. The
    following list shows how properties are mapped:

    \list
    \li bool, int, real -> bool, int, float
    \li QColor, \l{QtQml::Qt::rgba()}{color} -> vec4, and the color gets
    converted to linear, assuming sRGB space for the color value specified in
    QML. The built-in Qt colors, such as \c{"green"} are in sRGB color space as
    well, and the same conversion is performed for all color properties of
    DefaultMaterial and PrincipledMaterial, so this behavior of Effect
    matches those.
    \li QRect, QRectF, \l{QtQml::Qt::rect()}{rect} -> vec4
    \li QPoint, QPointF, \l{QtQml::Qt::point()}{point}, QSize, QSizeF, \l{QtQml::Qt::size()}{size} -> vec2
    \li QVector2D, \l{QtQml::Qt::vector2d()}{vector2d} -> vec3
    \li QVector3D, \l{QtQml::Qt::vector3d()}{vector3d} -> vec3
    \li QVector4D, \l{QtQml::Qt::vector4d()}{vector4d} -> vec4
    \li QMatrix4x4, \l{QtQml::Qt::matrix4x4()}{matrix4x4} -> mat4
    \li QQuaternion, \l{QtQml::Qt::quaternion()}{quaternion} -> vec4, scalar value is \c w

    \li TextureInput -> sampler2D or samplerCube, depending on whether \l
    Texture or \l CubeMapTexture is used in the texture property of the
    TextureInput. Setting the \l{TextureInput::enabled}{enabled} property to
    false leads to exposing a dummy texture to the shader, meaning the shaders
    are still functional but will sample a texture with opaque black image
    content. Pay attention to the fact that properties for samplers must always
    reference a \l TextureInput object, not a \l Texture directly. When it
    comes to the \l Texture properties, the source, tiling, and filtering
    related ones are the only ones that are taken into account implicitly with
    effects, as the rest (such as, UV transformations) is up to the custom
    shaders to implement as they see fit.

    \endlist

    \note When a uniform referenced in the shader code does not have a
    corresponding property, it will cause a shader compilation error when
    processing the effect at run time. There are some exceptions to this,
    such as, sampler uniforms, that get a dummy texture bound when no
    corresponding QML property is present, but as a general rule, all uniforms
    and samplers must have a corresponding property declared in the
    Effect object.

    \section1 Getting started with user-defined effects

    A custom post-processing effect involves at minimum an Effect object and a
    fragment shader snippet. Some effects will also want a customized vertex
    shader as well.

    As a simple example, let's create an effect that combines the scene's
    content with an image, while further altering the red channel's value in an
    animated manner:

    \table 70%
    \row
    \li \qml
    Effect {
        id: simpleEffect
        property TextureInput tex: TextureInput {
            texture: Texture { source: "image.png" }
        }
        property real redLevel
        NumberAnimation on redLevel { from: 0; to: 1; duration: 5000; loops: -1 }
        passes: Pass {
           shaders: Shader {
               stage: Shader.Fragment
               shader: "effect.frag"
           }
        }
    }
    \endqml
    \li \badcode
    void MAIN()
    {
        vec4 c = texture(tex, TEXTURE_UV);
        c.r *= redLevel;
        FRAGCOLOR = c * texture(INPUT, INPUT_UV);
    }
    \endcode
    \endtable

    Here the texture with the image \c{image.png} is exposed to the shader under
    the name \c tex. The value of redLevel is available in the shader in a \c
    float uniform with the same name.

    The fragment shader must contain a function called \c MAIN. The final
    fragment color is determined by \c FRAGCOLOR. The main input texture, with
    the contents of the View3D's scene, is accessible under a \c sampler2D with
    the name \c INPUT. The UV coordinates from the quad are in \c
    INPUT_UV. These UV values are always suitable for sampling \c INPUT,
    regardless of the underlying graphics API at run time (and so regardless of
    the Y axis direction in images since the necessary adjustments are applied
    automatically by Qt Quick 3D). Sampling the texture with our external image
    is done using \c TEXTURE_UV. \c INPUT_UV is not suitable in cross-platform
    applications since V needs to be flipped to cater for the coordinate system
    differences mentioned before, using a logic that is different for textures
    based on images and textures used as render targets. Fortunately this is all
    taken care of by the engine so the shader need no further logic for this.

    Once simpleEffect is available, it can be associated with the effects list
    of a the View3D's SceneEnvironment:

    \qml
    environment: SceneEnvironment {
        effects: [ simpleEffect ]
    }
    \endqml

    The results would look something like the following, with the original scene
    on the left and with the effect applied on the right:

    \table 70%
    \row
    \li \image effect_intro_1.png
    \li \image effect_intro_2.png
    \endtable

    \note The \c shader property value in Shader is a URL, as is the custom in
    QML and Qt Quick, referencing the file containing the shader snippet, and
    works very similarly to ShaderEffect or
    \l{Image::source}{Image.source}. Only the \c file and \c qrc schemes are
    supported.. It is also possible to omit the \c file scheme, allowing to
    specify a relative path in a convenient way. Such a path is resolved
    relative to the component's (the \c{.qml} file's) location.

    \note Shader code is always provided using Vulkan-style GLSL, regardless of
    the graphics API used by Qt at run time.

    \note The vertex and fragment shader code provided by the effect are not
    full, complete GLSL shaders on their own. Rather, they provide a \c MAIN
    function, and optionally a set of \c VARYING declarations, which are then
    amended with further shader code by the engine.

    \section1 Effects with vertex shaders

    A vertex shader, when present, must provide a function called \c MAIN. In
    the vast majority of cases the custom vertex shader will not want to provide
    its own calculation of the homogenous vertex position, but it is possible
    using \c POSITION, \c VERTEX, and \c MODELVIEWPROJECTION_MATRIX. When
    \c POSITION is not present in the custom shader code, a statement equivalent to
    \c{POSITION = MODELVIEWPROJECTION_MATRIX * vec4(VERTEX, 1.0);} will be
    injected automatically by Qt Quick 3D.

    To pass data between the vertex and fragment shaders, use the VARYING
    keyword. Internally this will then be transformed into the appropriate
    vertex output or fragment input declaration. The fragment shader can use the
    same declaration, which then allows to read the interpolated value for the
    current fragment.

    Let's look at example, that is in effect very similar to the built-in
    DistortionSpiral effect:

    \table 70%
    \row
    \li \badcode
    VARYING vec2 center_vec;
    void MAIN()
    {
        center_vec = INPUT_UV - vec2(0.5, 0.5);
        center_vec.y *= INPUT_SIZE.y / INPUT_SIZE.x;
    }
    \endcode
    \li \badcode
    VARYING vec2 center_vec;
    void MAIN()
    {
        float radius = 0.25;
        float dist_to_center = length(center_vec) / radius;
        vec2 texcoord = INPUT_UV;
        if (dist_to_center <= 1.0) {
            float rotation_amount = (1.0 - dist_to_center) * (1.0 - dist_to_center);
            float r = radians(360.0) * rotation_amount / 4.0;
            mat2 rotation = mat2(cos(r), sin(r), -sin(r), cos(r));
            texcoord = vec2(0.5, 0.5) + rotation * (INPUT_UV - vec2(0.5, 0.5));
        }
        FRAGCOLOR = texture(INPUT, texcoord);
    }
    \endcode
    \endtable

    The Effect object's \c passes list should now specify both the vertex and
    fragment snippets:

    \qml
        passes: Pass {
           shaders: [
               Shader {
                   stage: Shader.Vertex
                   shader: "effect.vert"
               },
               Shader {
                   stage: Shader.Fragment
                   shader: "effect.frag"
               }
            ]
        }
    \endqml

    The end result looks like the following:

    \table 70%
    \row
    \li \image effect_intro_1.png
    \li \image effect_intro_3.png
    \endtable

    \section1 Special keywords in effect shaders

    \list

    \li \c VARYING - Declares a vertex output or fragment input, depending on the type of the current shader.
    \li \c MAIN - This function must always be present in an effect shader.
    \li \c FRAGCOLOR - \c vec4 - The final fragment color; the output of the fragment shader. (fragment shader only)
    \li \c POSITION - \c vec4 - The homogenous position calculated in the vertex shader. (vertex shader only)
    \li \c MODELVIEWPROJECTION_MATRIX - \c mat4 - The transformation matrix for the screen quad.
    \li \c VERTEX - \c vec3 - The vertices of the quad; the input to the vertex shader. (vertex shader only)

    \li \c INPUT - \c sampler2D - The sampler for the input texture with the
    scene rendered into it, unless a pass redirects its input via a BufferInput
    object, in which case \c INPUT refers to the additional color buffer's
    texture referenced by the BufferInput.

    \li \c INPUT_UV - \c vec2 - UV coordinates for sampling \c INPUT.

    \li \c TEXTURE_UV - \c vec2 - UV coordinates suitable for sampling a Texture
    with contents loaded from an image file.

    \li \c INPUT_SIZE - \c vec2 - The size of the \c INPUT texture, in pixels.

    \li \c OUTPUT_SIZE - \c vec2 - The size of the output buffer, in
    pixels. Often the same as \c INPUT_SIZE, unless the pass outputs to an extra
    Buffer with a size multiplier on it.

    \li \c FRAME - \c float - A frame counter, incremented after each frame in the View3D.

    \li \c DEPTH_TEXTURE - \c sampler2D - A depth texture with the depth buffer
    contents with the opaque objects in the scene. Like with CustomMaterial, the
    presence of this keyword in the shader triggers generating the depth texture
    automatically.

    \endlist

    \section1 Building multi-pass effects

    A multi-pass effect often uses more than one set of shaders, and takes the
    \l{Pass::output}{output} and \l{Pass::commands}{commands} properties into
    use. Each entry in the passes list translates to a render pass drawing a
    quad into the pass's output texture, while sampling the effect's input texture
    and optionally other textures as well.

    The typical outline of a multi-pass Effect can look like the following:

    \qml
        passes: [
            Pass {
                shaders: [
                    Shader {
                        stage: Shader.Vertex
                        shader: "pass1.vert"
                    },
                    Shader {
                        stage: Shader.Fragment
                        shader: "pass1.frag"
                    }
                    // This pass outputs to the intermediate texture described
                    // by the Buffer object.
                    output: intermediateColorBuffer
                ],
            },
            Pass {
                shaders: [
                    Shader {
                        stage: Shader.Vertex
                        shader: "pass2.vert"
                    },
                    Shader {
                        stage: Shader.Fragment
                        shader: "pass2.frag"
                    }
                    // The output of the last pass needs no redirection, it is
                    // the final result of the effect.
                ],
                commands: [
                    // This pass reads from the intermediate texture, meaning
                    // INPUT in the shader will refer to the texture associated
                    // with the Buffer.
                    BufferInput {
                        buffer: intermediateColorBuffer
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    \endqml

    What is \c intermediateColorBuffer?

    \qml
    Buffer {
        id: intermediateColorBuffer
        name: "tempBuffer"
        // format: Buffer.RGBA8
        // textureFilterOperation: Buffer.Linear
        // textureCoordOperation: Buffer.ClampToEdge
    }
    \endqml

    The commented properties are not necessary if the desired values match the
    defaults.

    Internally the presence of this Buffer object and referencing it from the \c
    output property of a Pass leads to creating a texture with a size matching
    the View3D, and so the size of the implicit input and output textures. When
    this is not desired, the \l{Buffer::sizeMultiplier}{sizeMultiplier} property
    can be used to get an intermediate texture with a different size. This can
    lead to the \c INPUT_SIZE and \c OUTPUT_SIZE uniforms in the shader having
    different values.

    By default the Effect cannot count on textures preserving their contents
    between frames. When a new intermediate texture is created, it is cleared to
    \c{vec4(0.0)}. Afterwards, the same texture can be reused for another
    purpose. Therefore, effect passes should always write to the entire texture,
    without making assumptions about their content at the start of the pass.
    There is an exception to this: Buffer objects with
    \l{Buffer::bufferFlags}{bufferFlags} set to Buffer.SceneLifetime. This
    indicates that the texture is permanently associated with a pass of the
    effect and it will not be reused for other purposes. The contents of such
    color buffers is preserved between frames. This is typically used in a
    ping-pong fashion in effects like motion blur: the first pass takes the
    persistent buffer as its input, in addition to the effects main input
    texture, outputting to another intermediate buffer, while the second pass
    outputs to the persistent buffer. This way in the first frame the first pass
    samples an empty (transparent) texture, whereas in subsequent frames it
    samples the output of the second pass from the previous frame. A third pass
    can then blend the effect's input and the second pass' output together.

    The BufferInput command type is used to expose custom texture buffers to the
    render pass.

    For instance, to access \c someBuffer in the render pass shaders under
    the name, \c mySampler, the following can be added to its command list:
    \qml
    BufferInput { buffer: someBuffer; sampler: "mySampler" }
    \endqml

    If the \c sampler name is not specified, \c INPUT will be used as default.

    Buffers can be useful to share intermediate results between render passes.

    To expose preloaded textures to the effect, TextureInput should be used instead.
    These can be defined as properties of the Effect itself, and will automatically
    be accessible to the shaders by their property names.
    \qml
    property TextureInput tex: TextureInput {
        texture: Texture { source: "image.png" }
    }
    \endqml

    Here \c tex is a valid sampler in all shaders of all the passes of the
    effect.

    When it comes to uniform values from properties, all passes in the Effect
    read the same values in their shaders. If necessary it is possible to
    override the value of a uniform just for a given pass. This is achieved by
    adding the \l SetUniformValue command to the list of commands for the pass.

    \note The \l{SetUniformValue::target}{target} of the pass-specific uniform
    value setter can only refer to a name that is the name of a property of the
    effect. It can override the value for a property's corresponding uniform,
    but it cannot introduce new uniforms.

    \section1 Performance considerations

    Be aware of the increased resource usage and potentially reduced performance
    when using post-processing effects. Just like with Qt Quick layers and
    ShaderEffect, rendering the scene into a texture and then using that to
    texture a quad is not a cheap operation, especially on low-end hardware with
    limited fragment processing power. The amount of additional graphics memory
    needed, as well as the increase in GPU load both depend on the size of the
    View3D (which, on embedded devices without a windowing system, may often be
    as big as the screen resolution). Multi-pass effects, as well as applying
    multiple effects increase the resource and performance requirements further.

    Therefore, it is highly advisable to ensure early on in the development
    lifecycle that the targeted device and graphics stack is able to cope with
    the effects included in the design of the 3D scene at the final product's
    screen resolution.

    While unavoidable with techniques that need it, \c DEPTH_TEXTURE implies an
    additional rendering pass to generate the contents of that texture, which
    can also present a hit on less capable hardware. Therefore, use \c
    DEPTH_TEXTURE in the effect's shaders only when essential.

    The complexity of the operations in the shaders is also important. Just like
    with CustomMaterial, a sub-optimal fragment shader can easily lead to
    reduced rendering performance.

    Be cautious with \l{Buffer::sizeMultiplier}{sizeMultiplier in Buffer} when
    values larger than 1 are involved. For example, a multiplier of 4 means
    creating and then rendering to a texture that is 4 times the size of the
    View3D. Just like with shadow maps and multi- or supersampling, the
    increased resource and performance costs can quickly outweigh the benefits
    from better quality on systems with limited GPU power.

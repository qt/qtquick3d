\title Qt Quick 3D QML Types
\brief Provides the QML types to include 3D items into a Qt Quick scene.

This is the QML frontend for using the spatial renderer and scenegraph. For the
time being, all 3D content goes through offscreen textures (FBO)s so that they
can be composed into Qt Quick scenes (as a QQuickItem).

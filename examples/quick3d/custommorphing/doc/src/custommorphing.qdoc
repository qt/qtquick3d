    \brief Demonstrates writing C++ custom geometry with a morph target.

    This example shows how to define a complex custom geometry in C++ that contains a base shape and a
    morph target, with normal vectors for both.

    \section1 Custom geometry

    The main part of this example is creating a custom geometry with a morph target. We do this by
    subclassing QQuick3DGeometry:

    \snippet custommorphing/morphgeometry.h class definition

    The constructor defines the layout of the mesh data:
    \snippet custommorphing/morphgeometry.cpp constructor

    The function \c updateData performs the actual uploading of the mesh geometry:
    \snippet custommorphing/morphgeometry.cpp updateData
    We call \c updateData from the constructor, and when a property has changed.

    The function \c calculateGeometry contains all the tedious mathematics to calculate the shapes
    and normal vectors. It is specific to this example, and the code will not be explained in
    detail. In general: to implement smooth shading, it's necessary to calculate the normal vector
    for each vertex. Mathematically, the normal vector can be calculated from the partial
    derivatives of the function describing the plane:

    In this example, we make it simple by using a cosine wave for the base
    shape, knowing that its derivative is a sine function.

    In practice, normal vectors can often be determined by geometric reasoning. For the morph
    target, we use the fact that any vector from the center of a sphere to the surface will be
    normal to the sphere at that point. Note that normal vectors in QtQuick3D must have unit length,
    which can be done by using \l QVector3D::normalized().

    \section1 QML part

    We define a morph target that corresponds to the one we created in the custom geometry, and do
    an animation on the weight, so it will cycle between the two shapes:

    Finally, we create a model using our custom geometry, and apply the morph target to it:

    \brief Demonstrates the use of different light types.

    This example demonstrates using three different light types in an application.

    \section1 Setting the Scene Lights

    \section2 Directional Light

    The directional light emits light in one direction from an unidentifiable source located
    infinitely far away. This is similar to the way sunlight works in real life. A directional
    light has infinite range and does not diminish.

    We setup directional light to emit red color and animate its rotation around x-axis.

    \section2 Point Light

    The point light can be described as a sphere, emitting light with equal strength in all
    directions from the center of the light. This is similar to the way a light bulb emits light.

    We setup point light to emit green color and animate its position in x-coordinate.

    \section2 Spot Light

    The spot light is similar to the point light, except that it emits light in a cone shape
    towards one direction instead of all directions. Aside from the cone angle, a spot light
    has the same characteristics and properties as the point light.

    We setup spot light to emit a warm color and animate its rotation in y-coordinate.

    \section1 Setting the Scene Models

    First we add two rectangle models to act as the floor and the back wall for our scene.
    These are useful for seeing light shadows.

    Then we add our main logo model which is rotated around y-axis.

    We also add small cube models to demonstrate position & rotation of each light type.
    These cubes scale bigger when user is accessing related sliders.

    From the settings panel user can then enable shadows and control visibility and brightness
    of each light separately.
